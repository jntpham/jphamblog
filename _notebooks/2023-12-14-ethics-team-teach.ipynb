    "As the internet is only going to expand with more and more users, intellectual property is only going to get harder to manage. The government tried to manage that with SOPHA, which tried to penalize copyright infringement, which led to significant backlash among many interest groups and internet companies. Because of this, intellectual property is going to become open access or open source as these violations grow harder to manage."
