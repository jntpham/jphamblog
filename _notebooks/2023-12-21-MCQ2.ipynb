    "\n",
    "Didn't notice in the while loop, the display and the operation were flipped, so the # was added before displaying the value.\n",

    "## Q28: Assume that the variables alpha and beta each are initialized with a numeric value. Which of the following code segments can be used to interchange the values of alpha and beta using the temporary variable temp ?\n",

    "Correct: I and III\n",

    "The code layout was confusing and as a result, I didn't know that it asked for code that subs both terms for temp, which would have made things a lot easier.\n",

    "WRONG: Device transmits audio as is\n",

    "In retrospect, I didn't relalize this answer option existed, as the answer I chose I thought was right as lossless kepted all of the data, but thinking into it, there is no compression at all.\n",
